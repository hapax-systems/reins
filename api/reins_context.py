"""reins_context — the tri-audience context-fact-bundle projection engine (convergence major-system #1).

Reins is ONE classified representational substrate rendered for THREE audiences (tri-audience):
    operator_cockpit  ·  the Yard Crow context  ·  the Hapax substrate
(+ the public_or_air channel for the livestream). It consumes the `reins_context_fact_bundle`
(reins-text-context-producer-contract) and projects it PER AUDIENCE, sealing each fact to that audience's
AIR channel BEFORE any derivation (count / sort / relation / salience / affordance) — so a field denied to
one audience can never leak through a derived channel.

Doctrine held here:
  * NEVER-INJECTOR / readout-only. Every function returns pure projection DATA. There is no send, dispatch,
    spawn, publish, spend, provider-call, or inject path in this module — action routes through the governed
    apply seam elsewhere. (coord-context-consent + never-injector-guard, baked in.)
  * Honest missing-state. A missing/denied/low-confidence fact renders absent / DARK / HOLD / stale /
    refused — NEVER a fabricated zero, live-positive, or default-certainty.
  * AIR default-DENY. An absent air decision is treated as `deny` (defense in depth), not `allow`.

Producer (spine/council bundle) lands later; this is verified against the contract's fixture now.
